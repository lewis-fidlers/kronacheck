# Checks the krona

Driving force is: `bin/krona`

`bin/krona fetch` => Will fetch new data and stored it in the `data` directory

`bin/krona cities` => Prints results for all cities

`bin/krona twitterpp` => Prints results for cities I'm interested in

`bin/krona csv` => Prints out a csv with all the data

It's very stupid, but it works.
